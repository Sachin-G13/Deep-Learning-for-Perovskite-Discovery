# Deep-Learning-for-Perovskite-Discovery
Developed a VAE model for efficient dimensionality reduction of perovskite crystal structures, enabling novel  material design and exploration within a reduced latent space. Processed CIF-extracted data into structured tensors (32x32x3), optimizing model input representation and  accelerating training convergence
